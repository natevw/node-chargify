Easy integration with [Chargify][0] for adding recurring payments to your
application.

# Important note #
    
This library inspired, and **has been superceded by [Fermata](https://github.com/natevw/fermata)**.
While Fermata's API is a little different, the codebase descends more or less directly from this library,
so the overall idea is very similar.

The main differences are improved callback arguments (an error is now provided for bad status codes)
and the removal of the `.add`, `.remove` and `.req` methods in favor of a generic HTTP method call syntax.

Oh, and also! Under node.js (and some browsers, not that that's relevant for this plugin),
Fermata behaves as catch-all [Proxy](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:proxies) object.
So in many cases you can actually drop the parentheses and treat the REST URLs native objects:
`site.subscriptions[42].components[5].get(callback)`

Other than that, you should find the new library quite familiar once you load the Chargify plugin (included):

    var f = require('fermata'),
        c = require('fermata/plugins/chargify');
    f.registerPlugin('chargify', c);
    
    var wrapped_site = f.chargify('example-site', "API_KEY"),
        some_subscription = wrapped_site('subscriptions')(42);  // or even `wrapped_site.subscriptions[42]`!
    some_subscription.get(function(err, data) { if (!err) console.log(data.subscription.state); });
    
By using [Fermata](https://github.com/natevw/fermata) you get the benefits of a more refined version of this API,
in a library useable with Chargify *and* any other RESTful services your app needs to connect to.


**(end of Important Note)**, this here library's API documentation below…

As of [version 0.2](https://github.com/natevw/node-chargify/pull/1), this module is essentially a wrapper around [Request][1], but adds a little
convenience for connecting to the [Chargify API][2].

## Example

You can normally require and instantiate at the same time using your Chargify
subdomain and API key.

    var chargify = require('chargify');
    var chargify_site = chargify('YOUR-CHARGIFY-SUBDOMAIN', 'YOUR-API-KEY');

List subscriptions:

    chargify_site.get('subscriptions.json', function(err, res, body) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log(res.statusCode);
        console.log(body);
    });

Load subscription #40:

    chargify_site.get('subscriptions/40.json', function(err, res, body) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log(res.statusCode);
        console.log(body);
    });

Create a new customer:

    chargify_site.post({
        uri: 'customers.json',
        json: {
            customer: {
                first_name: 'Joe',
                last_name: 'Blow',
                email: 'joe@example.com'
            }
        }
    }, function(err, res, body) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log(res.statusCode);
        console.log(body);
    });

## Documentation

Returns a chargify_site. The available methods are listed below.

- chargify_site.get(options, callback)
- chargify_site.post(options, callback)
- chargify_site.put(options, callback)
- chargify_site.del(options, callback)

The first argument can be either a url or an options object. he only required
key is `uri`. The only required option is uri, all others are optional. The key
attributes are listed below. See the [Request module's README][3] for a full list.

- `uri` - Required. The URI of the resource. `host`, `protocol`, and `auth`

## Testing

Before running the tests, you need to create a Chargify test site and specify
the site's subdomain and your API key in a JSON file called config.json.

Example config.json file:

    {
        "chargifySubdomain": "chargify-test",
        "chargifyAPIKey": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx-9x_"
    }

Then simply run:

    npm test
